# Functional programming

## Introduction

* High level of abstraction
* Based on lambda calculus
* Language of choice: Haskell
* Functional programming -> expressions > statements.

Example:

```haskell
--Add the first ten numbers together
sum[1..10]
```

* Install `Hugs`, Haskell interpreter (`ghci` is another interpreter)

## First steps

* Start `hugs` in terminal

Examples:

```haskell
> head[1,2,3,4] --take first element
1
> tail[1,2,3,4] --remove first element
[2,3,4]
> [1,2,3,4] !! 2 --element #2
3
> take 3 [1,2,3,4] -- generalization of head
[1,2,3]
> drop 3 [1,2,3,4,5] --generalization of tail
[4,5]
> [1,2,3]++[4,5] --append
[1,2,3,4,5]
```
* First element in list has index 0
* List different to array -> indexing bad idea, not in constant time
  but in linear

**Function application**: function application is denoted by
  space. Higher priority
  
```haskell
f a b + c*d --f(a,b) + c d from math
f a + b --f(a) + b from math 
```
* Haskell file (script) --> `.hs`
* Define function in script, then open Hugs with script as argument so
  that functions are available. If script is changed use
  `:reload`. Also possible to load using `:load` *script*
* *Infix operator*: `x `f` y --> f x y`  
* *Naming*:
    * function and parameter name must begin with lowercase
    * can use quotes (*prime*)
    * type has to start with uppercase
    * convention --> `s` at the end means list, `ss` list of lists
* Indentation like Python, implicit grouping
* Useful commands --> `:load` *script*, `:reload`, `:edit` *script*, `:type`
  *expression*,`:?` 
* Comments: one line `--comment`, nested:

```haskell
{-
very long
comment goes
here
-}
```

## Types and classes

* **Type**: name for a collection of related values. Example `Bool`
* Applying a function to a wrong type makes a *type error*
* `e :: t` --> `e` has type `t`
* *Type inference*: compiler calculates type of expression prior to
  execution. Haskell programs are *type safe*, type error never
  happens in run time
* `:type <exp>` to calculate type of expression

| Type        | Explanation   | 
|:----------: |:-------------:|
| `Bool` | Logical value: `True` or `False`|
| `Char` | Single character, enclosed in sigle quotes: `'a'` |
| `String` | String of characters, double quotes: `"abc"`|
| `Int` | Fixed precision integer |
| `Integer` | Arbitrary precision integer, doesn't overflow |
| `Float` | Single precision floating point number |

Table: Different types in Haskell


* **List**: sequence of values with same type. Can be infinite. Examples:

```haskell
[False, True, False]::[Bool] -- list of elements type Bool
['a', 'b']:: [Char] -- list of elements type char
```

* **Tuple**: sequence of values of different type. Number of elements
  is called *arity*. Finite number of elements because type of all
  have to be calculated.  Example:

```haskell
(False, 'a') :: (Bool, Char) -- length appears in type
```

* **Function**: mapping from values of a type to values of another
type. Examples:

```haskell
not :: Bool -> Bool
isDigit :: Char -> Bool

function :: t1 -> t2 -- from domain to range in general

```

* *Curried function*: functions that return arguments one at a time
  (functions can return functions):
  `a -> (a -> a)` equivalent to `a -> a -> a`, arrow associates to the
  right. Any function that returns more than one values can be
  curried. Useful for *partially applying functions*. **Most**
  functions applied in curried form, if tuples are not explicitly declared.

* *Polymorphic function*: functions not defined for a particular
type. Example:

```haskell
length :: [a] -> Int 
```

* Price for polymorphism: type variables start with lowercase and types
with uppercase

* *Overloaded function*: functions with same name but different
  types. In Haskell overloading means that there is a restriction in
  the type class. Example:

```haskell
sum :: Num [a] => [a] -> Int -- only numeric values allowed
```

## Defining functions

### Conditional expressions

Example:

```haskell
abs :: Int -> Int
abs n = if n >=0 then n else -n
```

* Can be nested
* Conditional expressions **must** have an `else` branch

### Guarded equation:

* Sequence of logical expressions
* Alternative to conditional (Haskell people
  prefer this)

```haskell
abs n | n >= 0    = n -- |= such that
      | otherwise = -n
```

* Can be used to make definitions involving multiple conditions

### Pattern matching

```haskell
(&&) :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool
True && True = True
_    && _    = False --anything but True&&True 
```

More efficient way using wildcard + lazy evaluation:

```haskell
(&&) :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool
True  && b = b -- True && something --> something
False && _ = False -- always False
```
* Order is important
* Patterns may not repeat variables: all the variables inside the
  pattern have to be different

* *Lists in pattern matching*: use *cons* definition (`:`)[^list]. Only
  matches not empty list. These pattern must be parethesized because
  function application has higher priority.

```haskell
head :: [a ] â†’ a
head (x : ) = x
```

[^list]: Lists are constructed one element at a time from the empty
  list using *cons operator* `[1,2,3] = 1:(2:(3:[]))= 1:2:3:[]` 

### Lambda expressions

Functions can be constructed without naming using *lambda
expressions*:

```haskell
\x -> x + x --\x = \lambda x (from lambda calculus) 
```

* Useful for currying:

```haskell
add x y = x + y
add = \x -> (\y -> x+y)
```

* For returning functions as results

* For avoiding naming functions only used once:

```haskell
odds n = map f [0..n-1]
         where
		  f x = x*2 +1

odds n = map (\x -> x*2 + 1)[0..n-1] --pass lambda as parameter to map
``` 

### Sections

Operator written between two arguments can be used in curried way
using parenthesis:

```haskell
--Examples:
(1+) --sucessor
(1/) --reciprocate
(*2) --double
(/2) --half
```

For avoiding naming. 

## List comprehensions

* Code that manipulates collections
* Favorite collection for mathematicians: **sets**. Problems with
  sets:
    * No duplication
    * Deal with equality
* Haskell has tricks to deal with sets as lists

* Set comprehensions in Math: $\lbrace x^2 | x \in \lbrace 1,...,5\rbrace\rbrace$
* List comprehension in Haskell: `[x^2 | x <- [1..5]]`
* `x <- [1..5]` is called *generator*
* Comprehensions can have multiple generators (similar to nested loop,
  x is the outer loop and y is the inner):

```haskell
> [(x,y) | x <- [1,2,3], y <- [4,5]]
> [(1,4),(1,5),(2,4),(2,5),(3,4),(3,5)]
> [(x,y) | y <- [4,5],  x <- [1,2,3]]
> [(1,4),(2,4),(3,4),(1,5),(2,5),(3,5)]
```

* Generators can depend on each other, as in loops: 

```haskell
> [(x,y) | x <- [1,2,3], y <- [x..3]]
> [(1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(2,2),(2,3),(3,3)]
```

* Very concise code
* Filters (*guards*): `[x | x <- [1..10], even x]`

### The zip function

* Combines two list to a list of pairs
* Useful when programming with list comprehensions.

```haskell
zip :: [a] -> [b]-> [(a,b)]
```

### String comprehension

* Strings = character list `[Char]`
* Everything that can be done in lists will work with strings

## Recursive functions

* *Tail call elimination*

```haskell
factorial 1 = 0
factorial n = n * factorial (n-1)
```

* Some functions are simpler to define using recursions
* *Induction* can be used to prove porperties of recursive functions
* Recursion can be used also in lists:

```haskell
product :: [Int] -> Int
product [] = 1
product (n:ns) = n * product ns
```

Note: `:` appends element to list, `++` concatenates lists

* *Quicksort*: algorithm for sorting integers. Two rules:
    * The empty list is already sorted
    * Bolzano in the rest

```haskell
qsort :: [Int] -> Int
qsort [] = []
qsort (x:xs)=
  qsort smaller ++ [x] ++ qsort larger
  where
    smaller = [a | a <- xs, a <= x]
	larger  = [b | b <- xs, b > x]
```

## Higher-order functions

Higher-order functions are functions that take functions as arguments
or return functions as results.

Useful for:

* *Programming idioms*, avoid repetition 
* *Domain specific languages*
* *Algebraic properties* to reason about programs

### Map

Applies function to every element in list

```haskell
map :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
```

Map can be defined using list comprehension:

```haskell
map f xs = [f x | x <- xs]
```

Or recursively (for abstraction):

```haskell
map f [] = []
map f (x:xs) = f x : map f xs
```

### Filter

Removes elements that don't satisfy a predicate

```haskell
filter :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]
```

Definition using list comprehension:

```haskell
filter p xs = [x | x <- xs, p x]
```

Or recursively:

```haskell
filter p [] = []
filter p (x:xs)
  | p x       = x:filter p xs --cons 
  | otherwise = filter p xs --forget about xs
```

### Foldr & foldl

Homomorfism over list -> generalization of sum, product...

* r: from the right
* l: from the left

```haskell
f []    = v
f (x:xs)= x (+operator) f xs
```

Examples:

```haskell
sum = foldr (+) 0
product = foldr (*) 1
and = folder (&&) True
```
Replaces the empty list by `v` and cons by `f`

Useful for:

* For defining recursive functions
* Properties of functions defined usig foldr can be proved using
  algebracic properties
* Program optimization

### Other library functions

**Composition**: combines two functions into one

```haskell
(.) :: (b -> c)-> (a -> b) -> (a -> c)
f . g = \x -> f(g x) --first apply g, apply f to result
```

Example:

```haskell
odd :: Int -> Bool
odd = not . even
```

Use it sparingly because it's difficult to read

**all**: decides if every element in a list satisfies condition
**any**: decides if every any in a list satisfies condition
**takeWhile**: takes elements while condition is true
**dropWhile**: drop elements while condition is true

## Functional parsers and monads

**Parser**: program hat analyses piece of test and determines its
  syntantic structure

```haskell
type Parser = String -> Tree

--If there is unused output
type Parser = String -> (Tree, String)

--If there are more than one option of parsing
type Parser = String -> [(Tree, String)]

--Parsers can produce any type
type Parser = String -> [(a, String)]
```

### Basic parsers

Examples

```haskell
--Parsers single character

item :: Parser Char
item = \inp -> case inp of
                    [] -> []
				    (x:xs) -> [(x,xs)]
--case for pattern matching in the body of definition

--Always succeeds

return :: a -> Parser a
return v = \inp -> [(v,inp)]

--Always fails

failure :: Parser a
failure = \inp -> []
```

The function `parse` applies parser to input:

```haskell
parse :: Parser a -> String -> [(a,String)]
parse p inp = p inp 
```

### Sequencing

A sequence of parsers can be combined using `do`:

```haskell
p :: Parser (Char, Char)
p = do x <- item
	   item
	   y <- item
	   return (x,y)
```

* Parser can be combined using  `+++`(*else*) , if the first one fails, apply
  the second and so on
* Layout rule!
* If one parser fails, all fail

### Derived primitives

Using the three basic parsers we can define parser that returns single
characters that return characters that satisfy a given predicate:

```haskell
sat :: (Char -> Bool) -> Parser Char
sat p = do x <- item
           if p x then return x else failure
```

Using `sat` and different predicates we can define parsers for digits,
lower-case letters...

## Interactive programs

Interaction with keyboard and screen

**Problem**: Haskell programs have no side effects. Same arguments
  give same results. `Readline`, for example, does not give the same
  result all the time!

**Solution**: new type `IO a`, actions that have side
  effects. Function that return `void`: `IO ()` (empty tuple)

### Basic actions

Actions in the standard library. Examples:

```haskell
getChar :: IO Char --reads character from standard input
putChar :: IO Char --writes character to standard output
```

### Sequencing

Works like parsing

### Derived primitives

We can read a string from standard input basing on `getChar`, for
instance. 

## Declaring types and classes

* We can define new types in Haskell
* Things in common with objects in Object Oriented Programming

### Type declarations

Using `type` synonym between types can be defined. Example:

```haskell
type String = [Char]
```

* Type definition can be used for better readability
* Type declarations can be nested, but they can't be
  recursive[^recursive].

[^recursive]: Recursive declaration is only valid in nominal types (see [Data declaration](#data))

### Data declarations {#data}

Using `data` completely new types can be defined giving their values. Example: 

```haskell
data Bool = False | True --Boolean types can be True or False
```

* These can be declared recursively, because are data and types at the
same time.
* The new values of the type are called **constructors** in this
case.
* Types and constructors names must begin with capital letter.
* The same constructor name cannot be used in more than one type.
* Values of new types can be used as built-in types
* The construtors can also have arguments
* Data declarations can be parameterised

### Recursive types

New types can be declared in terms of themselves, if declared using `data`:
```haskell
data Nat = Zero | Succ Nat --Creates an infinite sequence of values
```

### Class and instance declaration

Classes are declared using `class`. Example:

```haskell
class  Eq a  where
   (==), (/=) :: a -> a -> Bool

       -- Minimal complete definition:
       --      (==) or (/=)
   x /= y     =  not (x == y)
   x == y     =  not (x /= y)
```

For a type `a` to be an instance of a given class it has to comply
       --      with the conditions in the class definition. For
	   instancing:

```haskell
instance Eq Bool where
  False == False = True
  True == True   = True
  _ ==_          = False
```

* Only types declared using `data` can become classes.
* Classes can also be extended to make new classes (inheritance) using
  `=>`

* For making a type instance of a built-in type use
  `deriving`. Example:

```haskell
data Bool = False | True
            deriving(Eq, Ord, Show, Read)
``` 

## Lazy evaluation

Everything uses lazy evaluation except you make things
strict. Features of Haskell evaluation:

1. Avoid *unnecessary evaluation*
2. Allow programs to be *more modular*
3. Allows *infinite lists*

Expressions are evaluated by applying definitions until no further
simplification is possible:

```
square n = n*n
square (3 + 4) --> square 7 --> 7*7 --> 49
```

If there are two different ways to evaluate an expression, the two of
them will give the same result (*pure language*, no side
effects). Makes it easier to refactor Haskell code.  

### Termination

* **Innermost reduction**: evaluates from the expression that has no
  expression inside

* **Outermost reduction**: evaluates from the expression that is not
  contained in any expression

    * May give a result when innermost fails to terminate
	* If there exists any reduction that terminates, outermost terminates
    * May require more steps because of duplication, this problem can
      be solved using **pointers** for **sharing**

Lazy evaluation
: outermost reduction with sharing

### Infinite lists

Lazy evaluation allows infinite lists, while innermost evaluation does
not terminate in this case.

### Lazy evaluation

> Using lazy evaluation, expressions are only evaluated as much as
> required to produce the final result.

So, an infinite list is only a *potentially infinite list* because it
is only evaluated as needed.

### Modular programming

We can generate finite list for taking elements from an infinite list,
this allows *data control*
